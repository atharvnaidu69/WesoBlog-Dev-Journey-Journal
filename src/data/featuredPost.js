  title: "Oops, We Built a Blog Too",
  content: `Welcome to our blog! This space is dedicated to documenting the journey of building our social media app from the ground up (and yes, writing this so we feel like we're productive).

Here, we share not only technical insights, design decisions, and feature ideas, but also the challenges, changes, and motivations behind them.

This blog isn't structured perfectly—it's real-time, evolving, and sometimes a bit messy—just like any real project. Our goal is to stay honest, focused, and consistent throughout.

Thanks for reading! Let's build something meaningful together.
